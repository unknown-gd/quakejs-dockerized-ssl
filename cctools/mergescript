# Merges the .pk3-files in ./myAssets with a file of your choice
# Adds the crc32-value in front of the pak3-file and creates the info you
# need to add to manifest.json
#
# I you add maps do not forget to update your mapcycle in
# base/baseq3/server.cfg!
#
# You need to have libarchive-zip-perl installed (calculating the  crc32 checksum)
# sudo apt install libarchive-zip-perl
#
# You need to have zipmerge installed (merging the files)
# sudo apt install zipmerge
##
# Maybe you have to install bash as well (if you use Ubuntu it should already
# be installed)
# sudo apt install bash
#
# The easiest way is to merge your files with either pak100.pk3 or pak101.pk3
# since you do not need to mess with the nodescript files and both files
# offer a lot of space for your maps and models. There seems to be a file-size-restiction
# when loading pak-files. Try to keep them under 75 MB!
#
#Example: ./mergescript ../base/baseq3/pak100.pk3
